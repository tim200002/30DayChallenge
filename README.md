# 30 Day Challenge

This project is a flutter Application with daily challenges. One can subscribe to a challenge to get a month full of daily activities.

It is my first real Problem, therefor the Code might be a bit ugly. 
During this Problem I learned a lot for example communicating with APIs using the BLOC-Pattern to Controll State. But also just Designing and Building an App in Flutter.

For my next Project I learned. To better document the Code. Better Structure what I want to achieve. And give Screens, Widgets better names.

At the Moment this Application doesn't work. The communication between the Backend and the Database is faulty
